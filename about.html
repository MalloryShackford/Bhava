								<h4>The Experience</h4>
								<p>True healing comes from acceptance, not resistance. That’s why at Bhava, we take a refreshingly liberating humanistic approach to wellness. With the absence of the strict controls and rigid rules, our guests can naturally let go and open up. Support, advice, and inspiration are always on offer, but it’s the guests’ innate wisdom that guides their experience.</p>

								<p>While many guests come with a purpose or a goal in mind, Bhava remains flexible to everyone's needs. It’s not necessary to book a program; visitors can simply join us for a relaxing  holiday and enjoy the restorative environment, complimentary wellness consultations and daily holistic classes. 
								As the days go by, our guests experience clarity of mind, upliftment of the mood, improvements of physical conditions and increase of vitality.</p>

								<h4>The Lifestyle</h4>
								<p>For many the fast-paced world in which we live has disconnected us from each other, our own true and divine sense of self and the perfect simplicity of being present in our lives. At Bhava, being reconnected can be a sublimely life changing experience. </p>
								<p>Here, our lifestyle is relaxed, informal and heartwarmingly comfortable. The services and facilities are bound together by a welcoming community spirit and supported by the invigorating energies of nature, art, and healthy cuisine. Nature is an ever-present part of the Bhava experience, a sensory symphony that nourishes and nurtures. Beyond the improvements in health and wellbeing, the synergistic experience we provide seems to take people effortlessly and spontaneously to unexpected levels of self-discovery and awareness.</p>

								<hr>
								<h4>The Cuisine</h4>
								<p>At Bhava, the cuisine is a fundamental component of the holistic health concept. The menus reflect our philosophy of healthy living and the celebration of different cultures, featuring fresh and healthy dishes with enough sumptuous twist to satisfy the most discerning palates.
								</p>
								
								<p>Our culinary team works jointly with our doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine and is influenced by their wealth of knowledge in functional medicine and cellular detoxification. It is based on principles of Asian healing traditions, as well as the latest nutritional research. The healthy, inspired cuisine is a fusion of Eastern and Western culinary traditions and menus include extensive vegetarian options as well as fresh seafood and poultry dishes. There are separate menus for those on Detox or Ideal Weight programs. Fresh juices, signature tonics, herbal teas and wines are also served.
